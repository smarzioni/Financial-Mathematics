# Financial-Mathematics
Exercises and test studying Financial Mathematics and its implementation in C++


This Repository contains all the code I am typing/copying/trying in my way of studying Financial Mathematics and security pricing in C++.

The Folder M. Joshi Design Patterns and Derivatives Pricing contains the code I copied from Mark Joshi's book and some of the exercise I attempted.
  As almost all the code is copied from the textbook or written by myself, it is definitely prone to have mistakes and bugs. Use it at your own risk
  
The Folder FinalBuild contains my tentative to build over the material of Joshi's book to have a basic toolset in C++ to price derivatives.
  It is in its pre-initial status but I will add functionalites over time as I progress. Hopefully this will be an exercise on Object Oriented design patterns.
